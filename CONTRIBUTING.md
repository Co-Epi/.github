# Contributing to a CoEpi repository

Thanks for your interest in contributing to CoEpi! If you haven’t, please see [CoEpi.org/vision](https://www.coepi.org/vision.html) and [our collaborations page](https://www.coepi.org/collaborations) for high level direction on our current focus areas.

We have a variety of frontend and back-end development repositories, as well as repositories for the CoEpi.org website, background data-models, and more. This contributing guide applies to [all repositories under CoEpi](https://github.com/Co-Epi).

## Guidelines

Please note that the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Co-Epi/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) applies. 

### Committing changes and contributing new features

* Please make a fork of the repository and/or create a separate branch for each new feature you are working on. 
* For small changes to existing features, use a pull request from the changes on your fork back to the main repository branch that is relevant. 

## Get plugged in

* If you’re not already a member of the CoEpi Slack and are planning to contribute to development efforts, you can [email Dana](dana@OpenAPS.org) to be added. Please include a note about your areas of expertise and where you think you can contribute - e.g. note if you’re an iOS or Android developer, have expertise implementing UI, are backend, etc. 
* We have a daily development call for those who can join at 6pm PT, which is linked from Slack. If you’re looking to get started, feel free to jump into the relevant Slack channel, or jump into the daily call and get direction on where help is most needed.
